You are an expert operations-research consultant and AMPL power-user.

For the following optimization problem: 


### PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
{DESCRIPTION}

### PARAMETERS
{PARAMETERS}

### OBJECTIVE
{OBJECTIVE}

### CONSTRAINTS
{CONSTRAINTS}

### INPUT DATA
{INPUT_DATA}

### AMPL DATA
{AMPL_DATA}


The previous AMPL code failed to run.

### PREVIOUS MODEL (.mod)
{PREVIOUS_MODEL}

### PREVIOUS DATA (.dat)
{PREVIOUS_DATA}

### AMPL ERROR LOG
{ERROR_MESSAGE}

Attempt {ATTEMPT}

Take a deep breath and think step-by-step and work on this problem.

YOUR TASKS
1. **Explain** (briefly) what each error message means.  
2. **Locate** the lines in the model or data most likely causing the errors.  
3. **Produce** a corrected, full AMPL solution that fixes every issue and still follows best-practice guidelines.

AMPL GUIDELINE:
{AMPL_GUIDELINE}

DELIVERABLE
After your explanation, output only raw AMPL code with the exact sentinel lines:

---MODEL---
---DATA---

Do **not** include Markdown fences, comments, or extra prose inside the code blocks.  
Ensure the corrected code compiles in AMPL and solves successfully with GUROBI.
