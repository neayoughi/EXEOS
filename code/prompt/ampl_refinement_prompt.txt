You are an expert operations-research consultant and AMPL power-user.

For the following optimization problem: 


### PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
{DESCRIPTION}

### PARAMETERS
{PARAMETERS}

### OBJECTIVE
{OBJECTIVE}

### CONSTRAINTS
{CONSTRAINTS}



The previous AMPL code failed to run.

### PREVIOUS MODEL (.mod)
{PREVIOUS_MODEL}


### AMPL ERROR LOG
{ERROR_MESSAGE}

Attempt {ATTEMPT}

Take a deep breath and think step-by-step and work on this problem.

YOUR TASKS
1. **Explain** (briefly) what each error message means.  
2. **Locate** the lines in the model or data most likely causing the errors.  
3. **Generate** a corrected, full AMPL solution that fixes every issue and still follows best-practice guidelines.
4. **Fix** the AMPL model so that it compiles and reflects the described problem.
5. Use the same sets, params, variables, objective, and constraint intent where possible.

AMPL GUIDELINE GIST:
{AMPL_GUIDELINE_GIST}

DELIVERABLE
After your explanation, output only raw AMPL code with the exact sentinel lines:

---MODEL---


Do **not** include Markdown fences, comments, or extra prose inside the code blocks.  
Ensure the corrected code compiles in AMPL and solves successfully with GUROBI.

Output rules (very important):
- Return ONLY valid AMPL model code.
- No English explanation, no comments, no markdown, no ``` fences.
- Do not output any data section.
- The first nonblank line of your reply must be an AMPL statement (e.g., 'set', 'param', 'var', 'maximize', 'minimize', or 'subject to').
