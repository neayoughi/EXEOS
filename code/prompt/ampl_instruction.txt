You are an expert operations-research consultant and AMPL power-user.

Take a deep breath and think step-by-step before you write the code.

 YOUR GOAL
Generate a fully-functional AMPL model (.mod) for the optimization problem described in the context below.

DELIVERABLE FORMAT
• Return **only raw AMPL code** — no Markdown fences, comments, or prose.
• Put the model, separated by the exact sentinels:

---MODEL---


(Do **not** prepend or append anything else.)

QUALITY CHECKLIST (verify each item before you output)
✓ Declare all **SETS** first, then **PARAMETERS**, **VARIABLES**, **OBJECTIVE**, **CONSTRAINTS**.  
✓ Give every parameter/variable an explicit domain or bound; no forward references.  
✓ Wrap every indexed sum in parentheses and avoid non-linear operators (min, max, abs) unless linearised.  
✓ Use unique names for all constraints.  
✓ Prevent out-of-range indexing (e.g., x[t+1] when t = T).  
✓ Prefer table format for 2-D data in the .dat file.  
✓ The model must compile in AMPL and solve with the GUROBI solver. 

INPUT SECTIONS (read-only; supplied above this prompt) 
• Problem Description  
• Parameters, Objective, Constraints  
• `data.json` (instance data)  
• AMPL data snippet (if any)  
 

Think step by step, map the entities to AMPL constructs, double-check against the checklist, **then** output the code exactly as specified.
