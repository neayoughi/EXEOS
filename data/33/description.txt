A manufacturer wishes to produce 1000 lb of an alloy that consists of two metals: 30% metal A and 70% metal B. There are five alloys available for purchase, each with known compositions and prices. Alloy k contains a fraction ratio[k, m] of metal m (either A or B) and costs price_k dollars per pound.

The manufacturer wants to determine the amount of each alloy to purchase, in order to produce the desired alloy while minimizing the total cost.

The decision variables are the amounts of the five alloys to buy.

Objective: Minimize the total cost of the purchased alloys.

Subject to:
- The total weight of purchased alloys equals 1000 lb.
- The purchased alloys must contain exactly 300 lb of metal A.
- The purchased alloys must contain exactly 700 lb of metal B.
- Amounts of alloys purchased must be non-negative.
