A discrete random variable Z can take the integer values 1, …, K (where K = 6). Let’s denote the unknown probabilities as:

- p_1 is the probability that Z = 1
- …
- p_k is the probability that Z = k

where k runs from 1 to K.

These probabilities p_1, …, p_k are the decision variables in the optimization problem.

Constraints:

1. All probabilities sum to 1:
   The sum of p_1 through p_k must be equal to 1.
    sum_{k=1}^{K} p_k = 1

2. Mean (first moment):
   If we multiply each k by its probability p_k and add up all these products (for k = 1 to K), the result must be equal to 3.
    sum_{k=1}^{K} k * p_k = 3

3. Second moment:
   If we multiply the square of each k (that is, k^2) by p_k and add up these products (for k = 1 to K), the result must be equal to 10.
sum_{k=1}^{K} k^2 * p_k = 10

4. Non-negativity:
   Each probability p_k must be zero or positive.
p_k >= 0 for all k = 1, ..., K

Objective:

We want to find how large the fourth moment can be. The fourth moment is computed as follows:

- Fourth moment:
  Multiply the fourth power of each k (that is, k^4) by p_k and add up these terms for k from 1 to K.

We are thus faced with a linear programming (LP) problem:

- LP for maximization:
  Find the maximum possible value of the fourth moment subject to the four constraints above.



Solving this LP will give you the upper bounds on the fourth moment of the random variable Z.
