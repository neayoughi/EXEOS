Suppose there are N available currencies. Each currency i can be exchanged for currency j at an exchange rate of rate_{i,j}. There is also a limit limit_i on the total amount of currency i that can be exchanged (either exchanged to or from another currency) on any given day. At the start of the day, there are start_i units of currency i available.

The objective is to determine how to exchange these currencies, using a set of exchange variables x_{i,j} representing the amount of currency i exchanged to currency j, in order to maximize the total amount of currency N at the end of the day.

Key Assumptions:
- No negative exchange amounts are allowed (x_{i,j} >= 0).
- The total exchanged amount of each currency i cannot exceed limit_i.
- The system does not allow for wealth multiplication through cycles (i.e., any cycle of exchanges will not result in more value than at the start).
