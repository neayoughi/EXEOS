Suppose there are 3 available currencies. Each currency i can be exchanged for currency j at an exchange rate given by the 3x3 matrix Rate = [[0.99, 0.9, 1.02], [0.95, 0.99, 0.92], [0.9, 0.91, 0.99]], where entry (i,j) is the rate from currency i to currency j. There is also a limit on the total amount of each currency that can be exchanged (either exchanged to or from another currency) on any given day: Limit = [1000.0, 200.0, 3000.0] for currencies 1, 2, and 3, respectively. At the start of the day, the available units are Start = [100.0, 50.0, 200.0] for currencies 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The objective is to determine how to exchange these currencies, using exchange variables x_{i,j} for all i,j in {1,2,3}, in order to maximize the total amount of currency 3 at the end of the day.

No negative exchange amounts are allowed (x_{i,j} >= 0).

For each currency i in {1,2,3}, the total exchanged amount cannot exceed its limit: 1000.0 for currency 1, 200.0 for currency 2, and 3000.0 for currency 3.

Using the rate matrix above, it is assumed that for any cycle, the product of the corresponding rates is <= 1, so no arbitrage is possible.
