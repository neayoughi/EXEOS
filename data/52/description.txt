A division of an auto parts manufacturer produces 4 different parts using 3 different machines.

Producing a batch of 100 units of part 1 requires 2 hours on machine 1, 4 hours on machine 2, and 6 hours on machine 3.
Producing a batch of 100 units of part 2 requires 1 hour on machine 1, 2 hours on machine 2, and 2 hours on machine 3.
Producing a batch of 100 units of part 3 requires 3 hours on machine 1, 1 hour on machine 2, and 1 hour on machine 3.
Producing a batch of 100 units of part 4 requires 2 hours on machine 1, 2 hours on machine 2, and 2 hours on machine 3.

Machine 1 is outsourced: it has no availability limit. Its usage cost is 20 dollars per hour up to 400 hours, and 30 dollars per hour for any additional hours beyond 400.
Machine 2 has a monthly time limit of 300 hours with a usage cost of 10 dollars per hour.
Machine 3 has a monthly time limit of 500 hours with a usage cost of 15 dollars per hour.

Each batch of part 1 sells for 570 dollars, part 2 sells for 250 dollars, part 3 sells for 585 dollars, and part 4 sells for 430 dollars.
The company must produce at least 10 batches of each part per month to fulfill contractual obligations.

The objective is to determine how many batches of each part to produce in order to maximize the total monthly profit.
