A division of an auto parts manufacturer produces NumParts different parts using NumMachines different machines.

Producing a batch of 100 units of part p requires TimeRequired[m, p] hours on machine m. Each machine m has a per-hour usage cost specified in MachineCosts[m].

Machines 2 through NumMachines have monthly time limits given by Availability[m]. However, machine 1 is outsourced: it has no availability constraint, and its usage cost depends on the number of hours used. Specifically, it costs StandardCost per hour up to OvertimeHour[1] hours, and OvertimeCost per hour beyond that.

Each part p has a selling price specified in Prices[p] per batch of 100 units. The company must produce at least MinBatches[p] batches of each part per month to fulfill contractual obligations.

The objective is to determine how many batches of each part to produce in order to maximize the total monthly profit.
