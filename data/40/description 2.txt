A transport company must send empty containers from its n depots to m ports. 

The number of containers available at depot i is given by numdepot_i. The number of containers required at port j is given by numport_j. Containers are transported using barges, each of which can carry exactly two containers.

The cost of transporting one barge is proportional to the distance traveled between depot i and port j, where the per-kilometer cost is given by price. The distances between depot i and port j are specified by distance_{i,j}.

The objective is to determine how many containers to transport from each depot to each port in order to minimize the total transportation cost.

Let number_{i,j} be the number of containers sent from depot i to port j.
