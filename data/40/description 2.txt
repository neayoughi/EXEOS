Wild Sports manufactures several different products using a selection of raw materials.

Each raw material is available in limited quantity. Every product requires specific amounts of these materials for production. In addition, each product has a known selling price and a corresponding production cost per unit.

The company also forecasts the maximum number of units it expects to sell for each product during the month.

The objective is to determine how many units of each product the company should produce in order to maximize its total monthly profit. Profit is calculated by subtracting the total production costs from the total revenue generated by selling the products.

The production plan must ensure the following:

The use of each raw material does not exceed its available supply.

The number of units produced for each product does not exceed its forecasted demand.

All production quantities must be zero or greater.

By following these guidelines, Wild Sports aims to maximize its profit for the month.
