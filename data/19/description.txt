An engineering factory produces 7 products using 5 types of machines over a period of 6 months. Each product generates a profit equal to its selling price minus the cost of raw materials. The per-unit profits are: product 1 = 10, product 2 = 6, product 3 = 8, product 4 = 4, product 5 = 11, product 6 = 9, product 7 = 3.

Producing one unit of each product requires processing time on the five machine types as follows (hours per unit): product 1: [0.5, 0.1, 0.2, 0.05, 0] by machine types 1–5 respectively; product 2: [0.7, 0.2, 0, 0.03, 0] by machine types 1–5 respectively; product 3: [0, 0, 0.8, 0, 0.01] by machine types 1–5 respectively; product 4: [0, 0.3, 0, 0.07, 0] by machine types 1–5 respectively; product 5: [0.3, 0, 0, 0.1, 0.05] by machine types 1–5 respectively; product 6: [0.2, 0.6, 0, 0, 0] by machine types 1–5 respectively; product 7: [0.5, 0, 0.6, 0.08, 0.05] by machine types 1–5 respectively. Each month some machines are unavailable due to maintenance; the counts of machines under maintenance are: month 1: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] by machine types 1–5 respectively; month 2: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0] by machine types 1–5 respectively; month 3: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0] by machine types 1–5 respectively; month 4: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] by machine types 1–5 respectively; month 5: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] by machine types 1–5 respectively; month 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1] by machine types 1–5 respectively. The installed numbers of machines by type are [4, 2, 3, 1, 1].

There are marketing limitations on the monthly sales of each product (units per month). The limits are: product 1: [500, 600, 300, 200, 0, 500] for months 1–6; product 2: [1000, 500, 600, 300, 100, 500] for months 1–6; product 3: [300, 200, 0, 400, 500, 100] for months 1–6; product 4: [300, 0, 0, 500, 100, 300] for months 1–6; product 5: [800, 400, 500, 200, 1000, 1100] for months 1–6; product 6: [200, 300, 400, 0, 300, 500] for months 1–6; product 7: [100, 150, 100, 100, 0, 60] for months 1–6.

The factory can store finished products up to a maximum of 100 units per product at any time. Storing products incurs a cost of 0.5 per unit per month. Initially, there is no stock, and by the end of month 6 exactly 100 units of each product must be in stock.

The factory works 24 days per month with 8 hours per day. After accounting for maintenance, the available machines by type are: month 1: [3, 2, 3, 1, 1] by machine types 1–5 respectively; month 2: [4, 2, 1, 1, 1] by machine types 1–5 respectively; month 3: [4, 2, 3, 0, 1] by machine types 1–5 respectively; month 4: [4, 1, 3, 1, 1] by machine types 1–5 respectively; month 5: [3, 1, 3, 1, 1] by machine types 1–5 respectively; month 6: [4, 2, 2, 1, 0] by machine types 1–5 respectively. This yields the following available machine-hours per month (machines × 24 × 8): month 1: [576, 384, 576, 192, 192] hours by machine types 1–5 respectively; month 2: [768, 384, 192, 192, 192] hours by machine types 1–5 respectively; month 3: [768, 384, 576, 0, 192] hours by machine types 1–5 respectively; month 4: [768, 192, 576, 192, 192] hours by machine types 1–5 respectively; month 5: [576, 192, 576, 192, 192] hours by machine types 1–5 respectively; month 6: [768, 384, 384, 192, 0] hours by machine types 1–5 respectively.

The decisions are the monthly production quantities, sales quantities, and end-of-month inventories for each of the 7 products across the 6-month horizon so as to plan production and sales over the entire period.
