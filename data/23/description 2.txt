A mining company is planning to continue operations in a specific area for the next five years. There are n_mines mines in this area, but it can operate at most n_maxwork in any one year. Even if a mine does not operate in a certain year, it must be kept open, in the sense that royalties are payable, if it is to be operated in the future. If a mine is not going to be worked again, it can be permanently closed, and no more royalties need to be paid. The yearly royalty payable for each mine k that remains open is given by royalty_k.

Each mine k has an upper limit, limit_k, on the amount of ore that can be extracted in a year. The ores from the different mines have varying quality, denoted by quality_k. The blending of ores from different mines results in a linear combination of the quality measurements. For example, if equal quantities of two ores were combined, the resulting quality would be the average of the individual qualities.

Each year, the total outputs from each mine must be combined to produce a blended ore of exactly the stipulated required quality requiredquality_i for year i.

The final blended ore sells for price per ton each year. Revenue and expenditure for future years are discounted at a rate of discount per annum.

The objective is to maximize the discounted total profit over the planning horizon by deciding which mines should be operated in each year and how much they should produce.
