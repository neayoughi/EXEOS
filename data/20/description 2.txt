In Factory Planning 2, the factory makes seven products (PROD 1 to PROD 7) using five types of machines: grinders, vertical drills, horizontal drills, borers, and planers. Each product k generates a profit equal to the selling price minus the raw material cost. Producing one unit of product k requires 
time[k,m] hours on machine type m.
For each product and month, marketing limitations limit[k,i] define the maximum units that can be sold. There is no initial stock, but at the end of June, a minimum of 100 units of each product must be in stock. Products can be stored up to 100 units each, at a cost of 0.5/unit/month.

The factory operates six days a week, two shifts per day, each shift lasting 8 hours. Each month has 24 working days.

The maintenance schedule is not fixed. Each machine type m must be down for a total of  downtime[m] months over the planning horizon, but the specific months for downtime are decision variables. This provides flexibility in choosing the best maintenance month for each machine to maximize profit while ensuring all constraints are met.

The objective is to determine:
How many units of each product to produce, sell, and store each month
In which months each machine type should be down for maintenance
to maximize total profit while respecting marketing limits, machine availability, and stock requirements.
