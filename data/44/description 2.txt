A company produces S different types of steel using A different alloys.

Each alloy a is available in a limited amount (available_a in tons), and contains a known percentage of carbon (carbon_a) and nickel (nickel_a). The company can purchase alloy a at a cost of alloy_price_a per ton.

Each steel type s must meet certain composition requirements: it must contain at least carbon_min_s percent carbon and at most nickel_max_s percent nickel. Additionally, the composition of any steel type must not include more than 40% of alloy 1.

Each ton of steel type s is sold at a price of steel_price_s.

The goal is to determine how much of each alloy should be used in each type of steel, and how much of each steel type should be produced, to maximize total profit.

Decision variables include the amount of each alloy used in each type of steel (alloy_amount_{a,s}), the total amount of steel produced for each type (total_steel_s), and the total profit.
