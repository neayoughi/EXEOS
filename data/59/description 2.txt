A paper company produces large rolls of paper with a width of large_roll_width inches.  
These large rolls are cut into smaller rolls to meet customer demand. There are M different types of smaller rolls.  
For each roll type j (with width roll_width_options[j]), the demand is demands[j] units.  
The company has N different cutting patterns available. For each pattern i, applying that pattern to one large roll yields patterns[i][j] rolls of type j.  

Determine the minimum number of large rolls required to satisfy all demands.  
The solution should specify how many times each cutting pattern is used and the total number of large rolls used.
