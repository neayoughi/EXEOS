A paper company produces large rolls of paper that are 70 inches wide.
These large rolls are cut into smaller rolls to meet customer demand. There are 4 types of smaller rolls.

Type 1 has width 17 inches, with demand of 40 rolls.

Type 2 has width 14 inches, with demand of 65 rolls.

Type 3 has width 11 inches, with demand of 80 rolls.

Type 4 has width 8.5 inches, with demand of 75 rolls.

The company has 49 different cutting patterns available. For each pattern, applying it to one large roll yields the following numbers of smaller rolls of each type (in order: type 1, type 2, type 3, type 4):
