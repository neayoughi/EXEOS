Custom Tees plans an online campaign across two web companies using A ad types. For each ad type a, the cost per thousand clicks is cost_{a}, the maximum purchasable clicks (in thousands) is max_click_{a}, the share of clicks from ages 18–25 is young_click_{a}, the share from ages over 25 is old_click_{a}, and the share of unique visitors is unique_click_{a}. The total budget is budget. Choose the purchased clicks clicks_{a} (in thousands) for each ad type to maximize total unique clicks. Ensure total spending does not exceed budget. Ensure total clicks from ages 18–25 meet goal_young and total clicks from ages over 25 meet goal_old. Ensure total unique clicks from ages 18–25 meet goal_unique_young and total unique clicks from ages over 25 meet goal_unique_old. Nonnegativity and the per-type upper bounds max_click_{a} apply to all clicks_{a}.
