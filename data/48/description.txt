A division of an auto parts manufacturer produces 4 different parts using 3 different machines.

Each batch of 100 units of part 1 requires 2 hours on machine 1, 4 hours on machine 2, and 6 hours on machine 3.
Each batch of 100 units of part 2 requires 1 hour on machine 1, 2 hours on machine 2, and 2 hours on machine 3.
Each batch of 100 units of part 3 requires 3 hours on machine 1, 1 hour on machine 2, and 1 hour on machine 3.
Each batch of 100 units of part 4 requires 2 hours on machine 1, 2 hours on machine 2, and 2 hours on machine 3.

The division incurs a cost of 160 dollars per hour for using machine 1, 10 dollars per hour for using machine 2, and 15 dollars per hour for using machine 3.
Machine 1 has an available capacity of 200 hours per month, machine 2 has 300 hours per month, and machine 3 has 500 hours per month.

Each batch of part 1 can be sold at a price of 570 dollars, part 2 at 250 dollars, part 3 at 585 dollars, and part 4 at 430 dollars.
To meet contractual obligations, the division must produce at least 10 batches of each part per month.

Additionally, extra machine time can be purchased.
For machine 1, no extra hours can be bought.
For machine 2, up to 80 extra hours can be bought at a cost of 15 dollars per hour.
For machine 3, up to 80 extra hours can be bought at a cost of 22.5 dollars per hour.

The objective is to determine how many batches of each part to produce and how much extra time to purchase for each machine, in order to maximize total profit.
