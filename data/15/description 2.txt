A company manufactures N types of products, each requiring assembly labor, testing, and raw materials.

For each product type i:
- It requires AssemblyHour_i hours of assembly labor.
- It requires TestingHour_i hours of testing.
- It uses raw materials costing MaterialCost_i dollars per unit.
- It is sold for Price_i dollars per unit.

Each day:
- The company can use up to MaxAssembly hours of regular assembly labor.
- It can also schedule up to MaxOvertimeAssembly hours of overtime assembly labor, costing OvertimeAssemblyCost dollars per hour.
- It has up to MaxTesting hours of testing labor available.


If the total daily raw material cost exceeds DiscountThreshold, the supplier offers a MaterialDiscount percent discount on the entire raw material bill.

Determine how much of each product type to produce to maximize the daily profit, calculated as total revenue minus the total cost (including raw material cost, labor cost, and overtime costs).

- Total regular and overtime assembly hours must not exceed their respective daily limits.
- Total testing hours must not exceed the daily limit.
- The raw material discount applies if the threshold is met.
