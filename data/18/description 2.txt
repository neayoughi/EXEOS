An investor has a portfolio of N different stocks. 
He has bought Bought_i shares of stock i at a purchase price of BuyPrice_i. 
The current price of one share of stock i is CurrentPrice_i, and the expected price in one year is FuturePrice_i.

If the investor sells shares, a transaction cost of TransactionRate% of the amount transacted is incurred. 
Additionally, the investor pays TaxRate% on the capital gains (the difference between the selling amount and the purchase cost of those shares).

The investor wants to raise a net amount of K dollars after accounting for both capital gains taxes and transaction costs, 
by selling shares. The objective is to determine how many shares to sell from each stock in order to raise the required money 
while maximizing the expected value of the portfolio one year from now.

How many shares to sell from each stock to achieve this goal.

Considering: 
- The total net amount raised by selling shares must be at least K dollars.
- The number of shares sold for each stock cannot exceed the number of shares bought.
- Non-negative number of shares sold for each stock.

The goal is to maximize the expected value of the portfolio one year from now.
