A small computer manufacturing company forecasts demand over the next 3 months. Monthly demands are 10 in month 1, 20 in month 2, and 10 in month 3. Each month's demand must be satisfied exactly, with no shortages. In any given month, the company can produce up to 5 units through regular production at a cost of 10 dollars per unit. Additional units beyond regular capacity can be produced using overtime at a cost of 12 dollars per unit. Units may be stored from month to month at a storage cost of 1 dollar per unit per month.
Decision variables (for each month t = 1, 2, 3): regular production r_t, overtime production o_t, and end-of-month inventory s_t.
Objective is minimize 10*(r_1 + r_2 + r_3) + 12*(o_1 + o_2 + o_3) + 1*(s_1 + s_2 + s_3).
Subject to demand satisfaction:
s_0 + r_1 + o_1 - s_1 = 10
s_1 + r_2 + o_2 - s_2 = 20
s_2 + r_3 + o_3 - s_3 = 10
(take initial inventory s_0 = 0)
Regular capacity per month:
r_1 ≤ 5, r_2 ≤ 5, r_3 ≤ 5
