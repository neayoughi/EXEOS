A small computer manufacturing company forecasts the demand over the next n months. Each month's demand must be satisfied exactly, with no shortages permitted. In any given month, the company can produce up to a maximum of max_regular_amount units through regular production, at a cost of cost_regular dollars per unit. Additional units beyond regular capacity can be produced using overtime production, incurring a higher cost of cost_overtime dollars per unit. The company can store units from month to month at a storage cost of store_cost dollars per unit per month. The objective is to determine a production schedule that minimizes the total cost, considering production (regular and overtime) and storage costs.
