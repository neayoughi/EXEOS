A company needs to assign I projects to J consultants. Each consultant can be assigned up to a maximum of max_projects_per_consultant projects.

Hiring consultant j incurs a fixed cost given by fixed_costs. Assigning project i to consultant j results in an additional cost defined by additional_costs.

The objective is to determine the assignment of consultants to projects that minimizes the total cost, including both the fixed hiring costs and the assignment costs.
