Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) plans to produce and sell five types of computer systems in the upcoming quarter. These systems fall into two main families: general-purpose systems (GP_1, GP_2, GP_3) and workstation systems (WS_1, WS_2). Each system has the following unit prices and per-unit resource requirements: GP_1 costs 60000, needs 0.3 disk drives and 4 memory boards; GP_2 costs 40000, needs 1.7 disk drives and 2 memory boards; GP_3 costs 30000, needs 0 disk drives and 2 memory boards; WS_1 costs 30000, needs 1.4 disk drives and 2 memory boards; WS_2 costs 15000, needs 0 disk drives and 1 memory board.

DEC has to make production decisions within several constraints. First, they have a limited number of CPUs they can use due to production issues, so the total number of systems produced cannot exceed 7000 units. Disk drives are also limited, with their availability ranging between 3000 and 7000 units, and the memory boards used in the systems have a similar availability range, between 8000 and 16000 units.

The company also faces demand limitations. Each system has a certain maximum number of units it can sell and a preorder requirement: GP_1 has demand 1800 and preorder 0; GP_2 has demand 999999 and preorder 500; GP_3 has demand 300 and preorder 0; WS_1 has demand 999999 and preorder 500; WS_2 has demand 999999 and preorder 400. Additionally, the company has to ensure that overall production of general-purpose systems meets a total demand of 3800 units, and workstation systems meet a total demand of 3200 units.

To manage shortages, DEC can substitute up to 4000 units of regular memory boards with alternative memory boards, but this is only possible for GP_1. Furthermore, some systems—specifically GP_3 and WS_2—do not require disk drives at all, giving DEC some flexibility in how to use available resources.

DEC’s goal is to decide how many units of each system to produce so they can maximize their profit, while ensuring they stay within the limits for CPUs, disk drives, and memory boards (including the use of alternative memory). They must also make sure all preorders are fulfilled and that they meet the family-wide production targets for general-purpose and workstation systems.
