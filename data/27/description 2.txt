A quantity y is known to depend on another quantity x. A set of corresponding values has been collected for x and y.

The objective is to fit the ‘best’ straight line y = b*x + a to this set of data points. The criterion for the best fit is to minimize the maximum deviation of all the observed values of y from the value predicted by the linear relationship.

Input:
- Number of observations: NumObs
- Observed y-values: Y
- Observed x-values: X

Output:
- Intercept: intercept
- Slope: slope
