A company needs to plan its production over a 12-month period. In months 1 to 12 the required deliveries are [100, 120, 110, 130, 150, 100, 90, 110, 95, 125, 130, 100] units. Units can be delivered in the same month they are produced or stored in inventory to meet future demand. The cost of holding one unit in inventory for one month is 5. If the production quantity in one month differs from the previous month, a switching cost of 10 is incurred for each unit of change in production level. To model this, an auxiliary variable is used to linearize the absolute value of production changes between months. Inventory at the beginning of the year is zero, and any inventory remaining at the end of month 12 has no value and does not incur storage costs. The goal is to choose monthly production quantities that minimize the total cost of storage and switching.
