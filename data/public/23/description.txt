A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements in future years. Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. Additionally, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, reducing the need for workers in all categories.

The estimated manpower requirements for manpower k in year i are:

Category 1, years 1–3: 1000, 1400, 1000.

Category 2, years 1–3: 500, 2000, 1500.

Category 3, years 1–3: 0, 2500, 2000.
The current strength of each category is [2000, 1500, 1000]. The company wishes to decide its policy regarding recruitment, retraining, redundancy, and short-time working over the next three years.

There is natural wastage of labour. A fairly large number of workers leave during their first year; after this, the rate is much smaller. Taking this into account, the wastage rates by category are:

Less than one year of service: [0.25, 0.2, 0.1].

More than one year of service: [0.1, 0.05, 0.05].
There has been no recent recruitment, and all workers in the current labour force have been employed for more than one year.

It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. In any one year, the maximum recruits by category are [500, 800, 500]. The redundancy payment per employee by category is [200, 500, 500].

It is possible to employ up to 150 more workers over the whole company than are needed (overmanning), with an extra cost per employee per year by category of [1500, 2000, 3000]. Up to 50 workers in each category can be put on short-time working. The cost of this per employee per year by category is [500, 400, 400]. An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of half a full-time employee.

The objective is to minimize total costs by determining the recruitment, overmanning, and short-time working levels for each category in each of the three years.
