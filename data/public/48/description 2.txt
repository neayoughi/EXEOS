A division of an auto parts manufacturer produces P different parts using M different machines.

Each batch of 100 units of part p requires time_required[m,p] hours on machine m.
The division incurs a cost of machine_costs[m] per hour for using machine m.
Machine m has an available capacity of availability[m] hours per month.

Each batch of part p can be sold at a price of prices[p].
To meet contractual obligations, the division must produce at least min_batches[p] batches of part p each month.

Additionally, extra machine time can be purchased:
- For machine m, up to max_extra[m] hours can be bought.
- The cost of extra time is extra_costs[m] per hour.

The objective is to determine how many batches of each part to produce and how much extra time (if any) to purchase for each machine, in order to maximize total profit.
