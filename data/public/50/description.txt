A small electric utility operates 3 power plants to supply 2 cities. Plant capacities (million kwh): plant 1 has 30, plant 2 has 25, plant 3 has 45. City peak demands (million kwh): city 1 needs 40, city 2 needs 60. Transmission costs (dollars per million kwh): from plant 1 to city 1 is 14 and to city 2 is 22; from plant 2 to city 1 is 18 and to city 2 is 12; from plant 3 to city 1 is 10 and to city 2 is 16. Choose shipments from plants to cities to minimize total transmission cost. For each plant, total shipped does not exceed its capacity. For each city, total received equals its demand. All shipments are nonnegative. The reported total cost is the minimized transmission cost.
