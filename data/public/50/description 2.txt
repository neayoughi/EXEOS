A small electric utility operates P power plants to supply electricity to C cities. Each power plant p has capacity supply_{p} million kwh. Each city c has peak demand demand_{c} million kwh that must be met simultaneously. Sending power from plant p to city c costs transmission_{p,c} dollars per million kwh. Choose shipments send_{p,c} to minimize total transmission cost. Respect capacity: for each plant p, the sum over cities of send_{p,c} does not exceed supply_{p}. Meet demand: for each city c, the sum over plants of send_{p,c} equals demand_{c}. All send_{p,c} are nonnegative. The total cost reported is total_cost.
