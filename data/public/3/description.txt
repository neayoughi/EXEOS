A state plans electricity capacity for 12 years (years 1–12). For each year, forecast demand and existing oil-fired capacity are known:

Demand by year [1..12] = [10, 15, 17, 20, 13, 19, 10, 25, 30, 33, 30, 35].
Oil-fired capacity by year [1..12] = [15, 14, 13, 10, 10, 7, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5].

The state may build coal-fired or nuclear plants. Coal plants last 5 years. Nuclear plants last 10 years. Once built, a plant produces for its full lifespan. So in year t, active coal capacity equals the sum of coal builds in years max(1, t−4) to t. Active nuclear capacity equals the sum of nuclear builds in years max(1, t−9) to t.

In each year, total capacity equals oil capacity for that year plus active coal plus active nuclear. Nuclear capacity is limited to at most 20% of total capacity in any year.

The goal is to choose coal and nuclear builds over years 1–12 to minimize build cost. Coal build cost is 10 per unit of capacity. Nuclear build cost is 5 per unit of capacity. The plan must meet demand in each year, respect the 20% nuclear share, and apply the 5-year coal and 10-year nuclear lifespans.
