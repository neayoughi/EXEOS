A company needs to plan its production over a T-month period. Each month t, a specified number of units, Deliver_t, must be delivered to meet customer demand. Units can be delivered in the same month they are produced or stored in inventory to fulfill future demand. The cost of holding one unit in inventory for one month is StorageCost. If the production quantity in one month differs from the previous month, a switching cost of SwitchCost is incurred for each unit of change in production level. To model this, an auxiliary variable should be used to linearize the absolute value of production changes between months. The inventory at the beginning of the year is zero, and any inventory remaining at the end of the year has no value and does not incur storage costs. The companyâ€™s goal is to determine the number of units to produce each month to minimize the total cost of the production and inventory schedule.
