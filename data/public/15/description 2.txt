We are given a set P ⊆ R^N, defined by M linear inequality constraints:
P = { x ∈ R^N | a_i^T x ≤ b_i, for i=1, ..., M }
where each a_i is a vector of coefficients in R^N and b_i is a scalar.

We seek the largest possible Euclidean ball fully contained within P. This ball has center y ∈ R^N and radius r ≥ 0. It is known as the Chebychev center of P.

To ensure the ball of radius r centered at y lies entirely within P, it must satisfy the following condition for each constraint:
a_i^T y + ||a_i||_2 * r ≤ b_i, for i=1, ..., M

Our objective is to maximize the radius r.
