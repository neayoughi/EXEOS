A hospital needs to schedule nurses for the night shift (from 12pm to 8am) over a 7-day week. Each day j = 1,…,7 has a specific number of nurses required: Demand = [0, 5, 9, 15, 4, 7, 3].

Each nurse works 4 consecutive nights and then has 3 days off before starting again. Therefore, the schedule “wraps around” to the next week if needed.

We want to find out:
How many nurses should start their 4-night work period on each day j ∈ {1,…,7}

This ensures that the number of working nurses on any day meets the demand for that day (0, 5, 9, 15, 4, 7, 3 respectively for days 1–7).

The objective is to minimize the total number of nurses needed to cover the week’s night shift demands, while respecting the work pattern of 4 nights on and 3 nights off.
