A seaport manages container logistics over 4 months. Each month, containers are unloaded from rail cars, stored in a yard, and later loaded onto ships. The number of containers demanded by ships is 450 in month 1, 700 in month 2, 500 in month 3, and 750 in month 4. This demand must be fulfilled each month.

Unloading a container costs 75 in month 1, 100 in month 2, 105 in month 3, and 130 in month 4. However, unloading is limited to 800 containers in month 1, 500 in month 2, 450 in month 3, and 700 in month 4.

If containers are stored in the yard until the next month, a holding cost of 20 per container is incurred. The yard can hold at most 500 containers. At the start, the yard contains 200 containers, and it must be empty at the end of month 4.

Containers are loaded onto ships using rented cranes. A maximum of 4 cranes can be rented each month. Each crane has a capacity of 200 containers, and renting one crane costs 1000.

The objective is to decide how many containers to unload and how many cranes to rent each month in order to minimize the total cost, which includes unloading, storage, and crane rental costs.
