The number of containers available at the depots is 3 at depot 1, 3 at depot 2, and 4 at depot 3. The number of containers required at the ports is 1 at port 1, 6 at port 2, and 3 at port 3. Containers are transported using barges, each of which can carry exactly two containers.

The cost of transporting one barge is proportional to the distance traveled between a depot and a port, with a per-kilometer cost of 3.0. The distances between depots and ports are as follows: from depot 1, the distances are 0.0 to port 1, 2.0 to port 2, and 5.0 to port 3; from depot 2, the distances are 2.0 to port 1, 0.0 to port 2, and 3.0 to port 3; from depot 3, the distances are 5.0 to port 1, 3.0 to port 2, and 0.0 to port 3.

The objective is to determine how many containers to transport from each depot to each port in order to minimize the total transportation cost.
