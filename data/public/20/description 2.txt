An engineering factory produces 7 products using 5 types of machines over a period of 6 months. Each product generates a profit, which is the selling price minus the cost of raw materials.
Producing a unit of each product requires a certain amount of time on each machine type. However, in each month, some machines are unavailable due to maintenance.
There are marketing limitations on how much of each product can be sold in a month.

The factory has the possibility to store products, up to a maximum of 100 units for each product at a time. Storing products incurs a cost of 0.5 per unit per month.
Initially, there is no stock, but by the end of the last month, 100 units of each product must be in stock.

The factory works 24 days a month, with 8 hours of work each day. The available machine time each month is adjusted based on the number of machines available after maintenance.
The main decisions involve determining how much of each product to manufacture, how much to sell, and how much to store each month, in order to plan the production and sales strategy across the entire planning period.
