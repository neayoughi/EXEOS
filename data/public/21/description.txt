In Factory Planning 2, the factory makes seven products (PROD 1 to PROD 7) using five types of machines: grinders, vertical drills, horizontal drills, borers, and planers. There are 4 grinders, 2 vertical drills, 3 horizontal drills, 1 borer, and 1 planer. Each product’s per-unit profit is: PROD 1 = 10, PROD 2 = 6, PROD 3 = 8, PROD 4 = 4, PROD 5 = 11, PROD 6 = 9, PROD 7 = 3. Producing one unit requires these machine hours:
• PROD 1: 0.5 on grinders, 0.1 on vertical drills, 0.2 on horizontal drills, 0.05 on borers, 0.0 on planers.
• PROD 2: 0.7 on grinders, 0.2 on vertical drills, 0.0 on horizontal drills, 0.03 on borers, 0.0 on planers.
• PROD 3: 0.0 on grinders, 0.0 on vertical drills, 0.8 on horizontal drills, 0.0 on borers, 0.01 on planers.
• PROD 4: 0.0 on grinders, 0.3 on vertical drills, 0.0 on horizontal drills, 0.07 on borers, 0.0 on planers.
• PROD 5: 0.3 on grinders, 0.0 on vertical drills, 0.0 on horizontal drills, 0.1 on borers, 0.05 on planers.
• PROD 6: 0.2 on grinders, 0.6 on vertical drills, 0.0 on horizontal drills, 0.0 on borers, 0.0 on planers.
• PROD 7: 0.5 on grinders, 0.0 on vertical drills, 0.6 on horizontal drills, 0.08 on borers, 0.05 on planers.

Monthly marketing limits (max units that can be sold, months 1–6):
• PROD 1: [500, 600, 300, 200, 0, 500]
• PROD 2: [1000, 500, 600, 300, 100, 500]
• PROD 3: [300, 200, 0, 400, 500, 100]
• PROD 4: [300, 0, 0, 500, 100, 300]
• PROD 5: [800, 400, 500, 200, 1000, 1100]
• PROD 6: [200, 300, 400, 0, 300, 500]
• PROD 7: [100, 150, 100, 100, 0, 60]

There is no initial stock. By the end of month 6, at least 100 units of each product must be in stock. Storage is allowed up to 100 units per product per month at a cost of 0.5 per unit per month.

Operating schedule: six days per week, two shifts per day, 8 hours per shift, and 24 working days each month. Per month, available hours when up are: grinders 1536, vertical drills 768, horizontal drills 1152, borers 384, planers 384.

Maintenance is flexible. Total downtime required over the six months: grinders 0 months, vertical drills 1 month, horizontal drills 1 month, borers 1 month, planers 1 month. The specific downtime months for each machine type are decision variables.

Objective and decisions: choose monthly production, sales, and end-of-month inventory for each product, and choose the downtime months for each machine type, to maximize total profit (sum of per-unit profit on units sold minus 0.5 per unit per month held in inventory), subject to marketing limits, machine-hour availability, storage limits, and the final stock requirement.
