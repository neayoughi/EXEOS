A division of an auto parts manufacturer produces 4 different parts using 3 different machines.

Each batch of 100 units of part 1 requires 2 hours on machine 1, 4 hours on machine 2, and 6 hours on machine 3.
Each batch of 100 units of part 2 requires 1 hour on machine 1, 2 hours on machine 2, and 2 hours on machine 3.
Each batch of 100 units of part 3 requires 3 hours on machine 1, 1 hour on machine 2, and 1 hour on machine 3.
Each batch of 100 units of part 4 requires 2 hours on machine 1, 2 hours on machine 2, and 2 hours on machine 3.

The cost of operating machine 1 is 160 dollars per hour, machine 2 is 10 dollars per hour, and machine 3 is 15 dollars per hour.
Machine 1 has up to 200 hours available per month, machine 2 has up to 300 hours available, and machine 3 has up to 500 hours available.
However, machine 3 and machine 2 can share their total availability, so their individual availability limits can be disregarded.

The division sells each batch of part 1 for 570 dollars, part 2 for 250 dollars, part 3 for 585 dollars, and part 4 for 430 dollars.
At least 10 batches of each part must be produced monthly to meet contractual obligations.

The objective is to determine how many batches of each part should be produced in order to maximize total profit.
