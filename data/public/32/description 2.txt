A balanced diet must be planned using 3 available foods, each with a unit price and a nutritional content in 2 nutrients. Let the price of food k be 1 for k = 1, 2 for k = 2, and 3 for k = 3. There are 2 essential nutrients, each of which must meet at least a minimum required daily intake: 10 for nutrient 1 and 20 for nutrient 2. The nutritional content of food k in nutrient m is given by the matrix [[3, 5], [1, 3], [4, 4]], where each row corresponds to foods 1, 2, and 3, and the two columns correspond to nutrients 1 and 2.

The objective is to minimize the total cost of the foods purchased while satisfying the nutritional requirements.The decision variables are quantity[k], which represent the amount of each food k to be purchased.
