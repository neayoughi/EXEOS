An economy consists of three industries: coal, steel, and transport. Each £1 of output from an industry requires inputs in £ from the three industries plus manpower. For coal, the required inputs are £0.1 of coal, £0.1 of steel, and £0.2 of transport, and £0.6 of manpower. For steel, the required inputs are £0.5 of coal, £0.1 of steel, and £0.1 of transport, and £0.3 of manpower. For transport, the required inputs are £0.5 of coal, £0.2 of steel, and £0.2 of transport, and £0.2 of manpower. There is a one-year lag in production: output in year t+1 uses the inputs committed in year t.

Output may also be allocated to build productive capacity for future years. To create capacity for £1 of extra production in coal, the inputs are £0.0 of coal, £0.1 of steel, and £0.2 of transport, and £0.4 of manpower. For steel capacity, the inputs are £0.7 of coal, £0.1 of steel, and £0.1 of transport, and £0.2 of manpower. For transport capacity, the inputs are £0.9 of coal, £0.2 of steel, and £0.2 of transport, and £0.1 of manpower. Inputs committed in year t for capacity deliver that extra productive capacity in year t+2.

Stocks may be carried between years. At year 0, the stocks are £150 of coal, £80 of steel, and £100 of transport. Productive capacities at year 0 are £300 for coal, £350 for steel, and £280 for transport. Yearly manpower available is limited to £470000000.

The objective is to maximize total production in the last two years of the planning period. Decision variables are produce[k,t], the production of industry k in year t; buildcapa[k,t], the amount allocated in year t to build capacity for industry k; and stockhold[k,t], the stock of industry k held at the end of year t.
