A delivery person starts at the intersection of 1st Avenue and 1st Street and needs to reach the intersection of 2nd Avenue and 3rd Street. The area between these points forms a 2 × 1 grid.

Each block in the grid has a specific walking time, which varies due to rush-hour pedestrian traffic. The delivery person may only walk north or west.

At each stage of the journey, the delivery person must decide whether to walk north or west. When at the intersection of Avenue w and Street n:

The time required to move west (to (w+1, n)) is given as follows:
• At Street 1, Avenue 1 → 3.5 minutes, Avenue 2 → 4.5 minutes
• At Street 2, Avenue 1 → 4 minutes, Avenue 2 → 4 minutes
• At Street 3, Avenue 1 → 5 minutes, Avenue 2 → 4 minutes

The time required to move north (to (w, n+1)) is given as follows:
• At Street 1, Avenue 1 → 10 minutes, Avenue 2 → 10 minutes, Avenue 3 → 9 minutes
• At Street 2, Avenue 1 → 9 minutes, Avenue 2 → 9 minutes, Avenue 3 → 12 minutes

The objective is to find the optimal path that minimizes the total travel time from the start to the destination.
