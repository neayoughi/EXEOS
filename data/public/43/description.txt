Custom Tees is planning an online advertising campaign using 3 different ad types across two web companies.

The company aims to achieve:

At least 500 thousand clicks from users aged 18–25.

At least 600 thousand clicks from users older than 25.

At least 250 thousand unique clicks from users aged 18–25.

At least 300 thousand unique clicks from users older than 25.

Each ad type has the following characteristics:

Estimated percentage of clicks from 18–25-year-olds: 40% for ad type 1, 30% for ad type 2, and 70% for ad type 3.

Estimated percentage of clicks from users over 25: 60% for ad type 1, 70% for ad type 2, and 30% for ad type 3.

Estimated percentage of unique clicks: 40% for ad type 1, 75% for ad type 2, and 90% for ad type 3.

Cost per 1000 clicks: 75 for ad type 1, 100 for ad type 2, and 120 for ad type 3.

Maximum allowable number of clicks (in thousands): 600 for ad type 1, 300 for ad type 2, and 300 for ad type 3.

The objective is to determine how many clicks to purchase from each ad type to minimize the total advertising cost while meeting all click and unique click goals.
