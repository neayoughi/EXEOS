A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements in the future years. Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. In addition, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, which will reduce the need for workers in all categories. The estimated manpower requirements for manpower k in year i is requirement_{k, i}. The current number of manpower k is strength_{k}.

The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to recruitment, retraining, redundancy, and short-time working over the next years. There is a natural wastage of labour. A fairly large number of workers leave during their first year. After this, the rate of leaving is much smaller. Taking this into account, the wastage rates of manpower k with less than one year's service is lessonewaste_{k}. The wastage rates of manpower k with more than one year's service is moreonewaste_{k}. There has been no recent recruitment and all the workers in the current labour force have been employed for more than one year.

It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. In any one year, the maximum number that can be recruited in manpower k is recruit_{k}. The redundancy payment to manpower k is costredundancy_{k}. It is possible to employ up to num_overman more workers over the whole company than are needed, but the extra costs per employee per year is costoverman_{k} for manpower k. Up to num_shortwork workers in each category of skill can be put on short-time working. The cost of this (per employee per year) is costshort_{k} for manpower k. An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of half a full-time employee.

The company's declared objective is to minimize redundancy. The decision variables are: recruit_{k, i}, overmanning_{k, i}, and short_{k, i}.
