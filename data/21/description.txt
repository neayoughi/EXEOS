A company is undergoing a number of changes that will affect its manpower requirements in the future years. Owing to the installation of new machinery, fewer unskilled but more skilled and semi-skilled workers will be required. In addition, a downturn in trade is expected in the next year, which will reduce the need for workers in all categories. The estimated manpower requirements by category (1â€“3) for each year are: Year 1 = [1000, 1400, 1000], Year 2 = [500, 2000, 1500], Year 3 = [0, 2500, 2000]. The current numbers by category are [2000, 1500, 1000].

The company wishes to decide its policy with regard to recruitment, retraining, redundancy, and short-time working over the next years. There is a natural wastage of labour. A fairly large number of workers leave during their first year. After this, the rate of leaving is much smaller. Taking this into account, the wastage rates for workers with less than one year's service are [0.25, 0.2, 0.1]. The wastage rates for workers with more than one year's service are [0.1, 0.05, 0.05]. There has been no recent recruitment and all the workers in the current labour force have been employed for more than one year.

It is possible to recruit a limited number of workers from outside. In any one year, the maximum numbers that can be recruited by category are [500, 800, 500]. The redundancy payments by category are [200, 500, 500]. It is possible to employ up to 150 more workers over the whole company than are needed, but the extra costs per employee per year by category are [1500, 2000, 3000]. Up to 50 workers in each category can be put on short-time working. The cost of this per employee per year by category is [500, 400, 400]. An employee on short-time working meets the production requirements of half a full-time employee.

The company's declared objective is to minimize redundancy. The decision variables are: recruit_{k,i}, overmanning_{k,i}, and short_{k,i}.
