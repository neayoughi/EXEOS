Consider the problem of operating a warehouse, by buying and selling the stock of a certain commodity, in order to maximize profit over a certain length of time, say n months. The warehouse has a fixed capacity capacity, and there is a cost holding_cost per unit for holding stock for one period. The selling price price_n of the commodity is known to fluctuate over a number of time periods indexed by n. In any period n the price holding for purchase is cost_n. The warehouse is originally empty and is required to be empty at the end of the last period.

To formulate this problem, variables are introduced for each time period. Let stock_n denote the level of stock in the warehouse at the beginning of period n. Let buyquantity_n denote the amount bought during period n, and let sellquantity_n denote the amount sold during period n.

The objective is to determine the amount of buying and selling in each period to maximize the profit over the months.
