We have a number of products that require processing on several machines (e.g., cutting and packing machine). The time required to produce one unit of each product on each machine is given in the data table ProduceTime. Each machine has a limited number of working hours available, also shown in the table AvailableTime. The profit gained by producing one unit of each product is in table Profit. The objective is to determine how many units of each product should be produced to maximize the total profit while respecting the time constraints of the machines.
