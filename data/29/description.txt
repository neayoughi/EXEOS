Determine the quantities to be produced such that all the production constraints are satisfied and the profit is maximized. We suppose that two products, A and B, can be produced, each of them passing through cutting and packing stages. The necessary time to produce 1 unit of product A is 2 hours for cutting and 3 hours for packing. The necessary time to produce 1 unit of product B is 2 hours for cutting and 1 hour for packing. The availability in working hours is 200 hours for cutting and 100 hours for packing. The unitary profits for A and B are respectively 20 and 10 euros.
