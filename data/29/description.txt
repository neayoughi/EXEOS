A number of power stations are committed to meeting the following electricity load demands over a day: 15,000 MW in period 1, 30,000 MW in period 2, 25,000 MW in period 3, 40,000 MW in period 4, and 27,000 MW in period 5.

There are three types of generating units available. The numbers of generators by type are 12, 10, and 5. Each generator of type 1 must operate between 850 MW and 2,000 MW; type 2 between 1,250 MW and 1,750 MW; and type 3 between 1,500 MW and 4,000 MW. Running a type 1 generator at its minimum level costs 1,000 per hour, type 2 costs 2,600 per hour, and type 3 costs 3,000 per hour. In addition, the extra hourly cost for output above the minimum level is 2.0 per MW for type 1, 1.3 per MW for type 2, and 3.0 per MW for type 3. Starting up a generator costs 2,000 for type 1, 1,000 for type 2, and 500 for type 3.

The objective is to determine which generators should be working in which periods of the day to minimize total cost.

Additionally, at any time there must be enough generators operating to make it possible to meet an increase in load of up to 15%, achieved by adjusting outputs of units already online within their permitted ranges.
