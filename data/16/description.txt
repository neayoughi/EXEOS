A company produces two kinds of products. A product of the first type requires 1/4 hours of assembly labor, 1/8 hours of testing, and $1.2 worth of raw materials. A product of the second type requires 1/3 hours of assembly, 1/3 hours of testing, and $0.9 worth of raw materials. Given the current personnel of the company, there can be at most 90 hours of assembly labor and 80 hours of testing, each day. Products of the first and second type have a market value of $9 and $8, respectively.

(a) Formulate a linear programming problem that can be used to maximize the daily profit of the company.

(b) Consider the following two modifications to the original problem:
    (i) Suppose that up to 50 hours of overtime assembly labor can be scheduled, at a cost of $7 per hour.
    (ii) Suppose that the raw material supplier provides a 10% discount if the daily bill is above $300.

Which of the above two elements can be easily incorporated into the linear programming formulation and how? If one or both are not easy to incorporate, indicate how you might nevertheless solve the problem.
