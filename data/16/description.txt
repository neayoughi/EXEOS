The refinery has two types of crude oil—A and B—with allocated amounts of 8,000 and 5,000 barrels, respectively. These resources can be used to produce two products: gasoline and heating oil, which sell for $38 and $33 per barrel, respectively.

There are three production processes available. Each process consumes specific amounts of crude oil and produces fixed amounts of gasoline and heating oil. Additionally, each process incurs a fixed cost per execution. The processes are:

- Process 1: Consumes 3 barrels of crude A and 5 barrels of crude B to produce 4 barrels of gasoline and 3 barrels of heating oil. The process cost is $51.
- Process 2: Consumes 1 barrel of crude A and 1 barrel of crude B to produce 1 barrel of gasoline and 1 barrel of heating oil. The process cost is $11.
- Process 3: Consumes 5 barrels of crude A and 3 barrels of crude B to produce 3 barrels of gasoline and 4 barrels of heating oil. The process cost is $40.

The goal is to decide how many times to execute each process (allowing for fractional executions) to maximize the refinery’s total revenue, defined as the total sales revenue from gasoline and heating oil minus the total processing costs.

The execution levels of the processes must be non-negative, and the total consumption of each crude oil must not exceed the allocated amount.
