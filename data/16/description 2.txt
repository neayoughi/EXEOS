A refinery has two crude types, A and B, with the available amount of crude A and the available amount of crude B for the month. These inputs can be turned into two products—gasoline and heating oil—sold at the selling price of gasoline per barrel and the selling price of heating oil per barrel.

There are several production processes. For each process:

crude A input per run

crude B input per run

gasoline output per run

heating-oil output per run

fixed processing cost per run

All quantities are measured in barrels. For example, one run of the first process uses its crude A input per run and crude B input per run to produce its gasoline output per run and heating-oil output per run, at its fixed processing cost per run.
