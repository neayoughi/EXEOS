A quantity y is known to depend on another quantity x. A set of corresponding values for x and y has been collected.

The k-th y value takes y_k, and the k-th x value takes x_k.

The objective is to fit the 'best' straight line y = bx + a to this set of data points by minimizing the sum of absolute deviations of each observed value of y from the value predicted by the linear relationship.

Output:
- intercept represents the intercept of the fitted line
- slope represents the slope of the fitted line
