In the knapsack problem, one needs to pack a set of 2 items in a container. Item 1 has value 10 and size 8. Item 2 has value 20 and size 6. The container has a maximum capacity 10. If the total size of the items exceeds the capacity, not all items can be packed. The task is to choose a subset of the items with the maximum total value that will fit in the container.

The decision variables are binary variables isincluded_1 and isincluded_2, which take value 1 if the item is included in the container and 0 otherwise.

The objective is to maximize the total value of the packed items.
