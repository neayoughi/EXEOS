A company needs to assign 5 projects to 3 consultants. Each consultant can be assigned up to a maximum of 3 projects.

Hiring consultant 1 incurs a fixed cost of 100, hiring consultant 2 incurs a fixed cost of 150, and hiring consultant 3 incurs a fixed cost of 135. Assigning project 1 costs 10 if assigned to consultant 1, 12 if assigned to consultant 2, and 20 if assigned to consultant 3. Assigning project 2 costs 10 if assigned to consultant 1, 8 if assigned to consultant 2, and 12 if assigned to consultant 3. Assigning project 3 costs 15 if assigned to consultant 1, 8 if assigned to consultant 2, and 20 if assigned to consultant 3. Assigning project 4 costs 10 if assigned to consultant 1, 6 if assigned to consultant 2, and 15 if assigned to consultant 3. Assigning project 5 costs 8 if assigned to consultant 1, 10 if assigned to consultant 2, and 15 if assigned to consultant 3.

The objective is to determine the assignment of consultants to projects that minimizes the total cost, including both the fixed hiring costs and the assignment costs.
