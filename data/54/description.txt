A division of an auto parts manufacturer produces 4 different parts using 3 different machines.

Each batch of 100 units of part 1 requires 2 hours on machine 1, 4 hours on machine 2, and 6 hours on machine 3.
Each batch of 100 units of part 2 requires 1 hour on machine 1, 2 hours on machine 2, and 2 hours on machine 3.
Each batch of 100 units of part 3 requires 3 hours on machine 1, 1 hour on machine 2, and 1 hour on machine 3.
Each batch of 100 units of part 4 requires 2 hours on machine 1, 2 hours on machine 2, and 2 hours on machine 3.

The hourly operating costs are 160 for machine 1, 10 for machine 2, and 15 for machine 3.
Machine 1 has 200 hours available per month, machine 2 has 300 hours, and machine 3 has 500 hours.

The selling prices per batch are 570 for part 1, 250 for part 2, 585 for part 3, and 430 for part 4.

For machine 1 only, a setup time must be added before it can produce each part: 12 hours for part 1, 8 hours for part 2, 4 hours for part 3, and 0 hours for part 4. No setup time is required on the other machines.

There are no minimum production requirements for any part. The goal is to determine the number of batches of each part to produce monthly in order to maximize profit.
