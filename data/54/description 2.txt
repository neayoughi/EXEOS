A division of an auto parts manufacturer produces 4 different parts using 3 different machines. Each batch of 100 units of part p requires a specific number of machine hours on machine m, as defined by the parameter time_required. The manufacturer pays an hourly operating cost for each machine, given by machine_costs. Each machine m has a limited number of hours available per month, defined by availability.

Part p generates revenue based on its selling price per batch, specified in the prices parameter. For machine 1 only, a setup time must be added before it can produce each part p, defined by setup_time. No setup time is required on the other machines.

There are no minimum production requirements for any part. The goal is to determine the number of batches of each part to produce monthly in order to maximize profit.
