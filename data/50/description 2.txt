US soybean suppliers must ship soybeans from terminal cities to various destination cities through intermediate port cities. The transportation network includes n cities connected by a set of routes A, each with a known transportation cost C_{i,j} per metric ton between cities i and j.

Soybeans originate from terminal cities, each having a fixed supply (Supply), and are required at destination cities, each with a specified demand (Demand).

The goal is to determine the quantity of soybeans to transport along each route to meet all destination demands without exceeding supplies at terminals, while minimizing total transportation costs.

Parameters to be used in the model:
- Supply: the amount of soybeans available at each terminal city.
- Demand: the amount of soybeans required at each destination city.
- Cost: the transportation cost per ton from each terminal to each destination.

The solution should specify:
- The quantity of soybeans shipped from each terminal to each destination (amount_{i,j}).
- The total transportation cost (total_cost).
