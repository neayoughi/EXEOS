US soybean suppliers must ship soybeans from 3 terminal cities to 4 destination cities. The transportation cost per metric ton between each terminal and destination is given as follows: from terminal 1 the costs are 34, 49, 17, and 26; from terminal 2 the costs are 52, 64, 23, and 14; and from terminal 3 the costs are 20, 28, 12, and 17.

The available supply of soybeans at the terminals is 150 tons at terminal 1, 100 tons at terminal 2, and 100 tons at terminal 3. The required demand at the destinations is 65 tons at destination 1, 70 tons at destination 2, 50 tons at destination 3, and 45 tons at destination 4.

The goal is to determine the quantity of soybeans to transport from each terminal to each destination in order to meet all demands without exceeding available supplies, while minimizing total transportation costs.

The solution specifies the quantity of soybeans shipped from each terminal to each destination and the total transportation cost.
