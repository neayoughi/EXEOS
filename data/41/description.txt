A division of an auto parts manufacturer produces 4 different parts using 3 different machines. Each batch of 100 units of part 1 requires 2 hours on machine 1, 4 hours on machine 2, and 6 hours on machine 3. Each batch of 100 units of part 2 requires 1 hour on machine 1, 2 hours on machine 2, and 2 hours on machine 3. Each batch of 100 units of part 3 requires 3 hours on machine 1, 1 hour on machine 2, and 1 hour on machine 3. Each batch of 100 units of part 4 requires 2 hours on machine 1, 2 hours on machine 2, and 2 hours on machine 3.

The cost of operating machine 1 is 160 per hour, machine 2 is 10 per hour, and machine 3 is 15 per hour. The maximum availability per month is 200 hours for machine 1, 300 hours for machine 2, and 500 hours for machine 3.

The division sells part 1 at 570 per batch, part 2 at 250 per batch, part 3 at 585 per batch, and part 4 at 430 per batch. To meet contractual obligations, the division must produce at least 10 batches of each part each month.

The objective is to determine how many batches of each part to produce in order to maximize total monthly profit, subject to machine availability constraints.
