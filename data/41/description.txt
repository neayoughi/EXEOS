Wild Sports manufactures three different products using three raw materials.

The available supply of the raw materials is 240,000 units of the first material, 8,000 units of the second material, and 75,000 units of the third material. Each product requires specific amounts of these materials for production:

Product 1 requires 48 units of the first material, 1 unit of the second, and 10 units of the third.

Product 2 requires 40 units of the first material, 1 unit of the second, and 10 units of the third.

Product 3 requires 0 units of the first material, 1 unit of the second, and 2 units of the third.

The selling prices of the products are 40 dollars for Product 1, 38 dollars for Product 2, and 9 dollars for Product 3. Their corresponding production costs per unit are 30 dollars, 26 dollars, and 7 dollars.

The company forecasts that it can sell at most 10,000 units of Product 1, 2,000 units of Product 2, and 10,000 units of Product 3 during the month.

The objective is to determine how many units of each product the company should produce in order to maximize its total monthly profit. Profit is calculated by subtracting the total production costs from the total revenue generated by selling the products.

The production plan must ensure the following:

The use of each raw material does not exceed its available supply.

The number of units produced for each product does not exceed its forecasted demand.

All production quantities must be zero or greater.

By following these guidelines, Wild Sports aims to maximize its profit for the month.
