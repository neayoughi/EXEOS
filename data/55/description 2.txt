A team of translators is being assembled for the Summer Olympics to translate from English into a specified list of other languages.
There are N available translators, each with an associated hiring cost and a set of languages they can translate into.
The goal is to choose a subset of these translators such that every required language is covered, while minimizing the total hiring cost.

Parameters from the data:

translators: A list where each translator has an id, a cost, and a list of languages they can translate into.

required_languages: A list of all languages that must be covered by the selected translators.

The objective is to determine the minimum-cost subset of translators such that all required languages are covered.
