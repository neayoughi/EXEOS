A small manufacturing firm produces five different types of spare automobile parts. Each of these parts must be produced in two stages: first in the casting shop, then in the finishing shop. The firm wants to decide how many of each part to produce in order to achieve the highest possible total profit during the upcoming month.

The resources needed for production are measured in worker-hours for each part and each shop. Specifically:

Part 1 requires 2 worker-hours in the casting shop and 3 worker-hours in the finishing shop.

Part 2 requires 1 worker-hour in the casting shop and 2 worker-hours in the finishing shop.

Part 3 requires 3 worker-hours in the casting shop and 2 worker-hours in the finishing shop.

Part 4 requires 3 worker-hours in the casting shop and 1 worker-hour in the finishing shop.

Part 5 requires 1 worker-hour in the casting shop and 1 worker-hour in the finishing shop.

The profit that can be earned for every 100 units produced of each part is as follows:

Part 1: 30

Part 2: 20

Part 3: 40

Part 4: 25

Part 5: 10

For the coming month, the total available worker-hours are 700 hours in the casting shop and 1000 hours in the finishing shop.

The firm must decide how many units of each part to produce in order to maximize total profit, while making sure that the total worker-hours used in each shop do not exceed the respective available worker-hours.
