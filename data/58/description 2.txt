A traveler based in StartCity needs to visit N towns for business.

The distance between each pair of cities (Distances[i][j]) is given in miles. These distances are symmetric, meaning the distance from city i to city j is the same as from city j to city i.

The traveler must start and end the journey at StartCity, visiting each of the N cities exactly once before returning.

The goal is to determine the shortest route that visits all N towns and returns to the starting city.

Parameters to be used in the model:
- N: number of cities
- Distances: a matrix containing the pairwise distances between cities
- StartCity: the city where the journey starts and ends
