Problem. A manufacturer must produce a final alloy with total weight given by the parameter AlloyQuantity. The alloy is made from K purchasable base alloys and contains M metals.

Parameters.

Price describes, for each base alloy, its cost per pound.

Ratio describes, for every base alloy and every metal, the fraction of that metal contained in the alloy.

Target describes, for each metal, the exact number of pounds required in the final alloy.

Decision variables. Amount describes, for each base alloy, how many pounds to purchase.

Objective. Minimize the total cost computed from Price and Amount.

Constraints.

The sum of Amount across all base alloys equals AlloyQuantity.

For each metal, the metal content implied by Ratio and Amount equals the required value in Target.

All entries of Amount are non-negative.

Data summary. K (number of base alloys), M (number of metals), AlloyQuantity, Target, Ratio, Price.
