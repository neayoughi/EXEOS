A hospital needs to schedule nurses for the night shift (from 12pm to 8am) over a 7-day week. Each day  𝑗 = 1,...,7 has a specific number of nurses required, called the demand for that day.

Each nurse works 4 consecutive nights (called a work period) and then has 3 days off before starting again. Therefore, the schedule “wraps around” to the next week if needed.

We want to find out:
How many nurses should start their 4-night work period on each day 𝑗

This ensures that the number of working nurses on any day meets the demand for that day.

The objective is to minimize the total number of nurses needed to cover the week’s night shift demands, while respecting the work pattern of 4 nights on and 3 nights off.
