An economy consists of three industries: coal, steel, and transport. Each unit produced by one of the industries (a unit will be taken as £1’s worth of value of production) requires inputs from possibly its own industry as well as other industries. The required inputs as well as the manpower requirements (also measured in £) are given by the parameters inputone and manpowerone. There is a time lag in the economy so that the output in year t + 1 requires an input in year t.

Output from an industry may also be used to build productive capacity for itself or other industries in future years. The inputs required to give unit increases in productive capacity (capacity for £1’s worth of extra production) are given by the parameters inputtwo and manpowertwo. Input from an industry in year t results in a (permanent) increase in productive capacity in year t + 2.

Stocks of goods may be held from year to year. At present (year 0), the stocks and productive capacities of each industry are given by the parameters stock and capacity.

An exogenous consumption requirement of demand for each industry must be satisfied in every year except year 0.

The objective is to maximize the total manpower requirement over five years.

The decision variables are:
- produce: amount of units produced by each industry in each year.
- buildcapa: amount of units used to build productive capacity for each industry in each year.
- stockhold: amount of stock of each industry held in each year.
