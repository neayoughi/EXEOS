A company produces 2 different types of steel using 3 different alloys.

Alloy 1 is available in 40 tons, contains 3% carbon and 1% nickel, and costs 380 per ton. Alloy 2 is available in 50 tons, contains 4% carbon and 1.5% nickel, and costs 400 per ton. Alloy 3 is available in 80 tons, contains 3.5% carbon and 1.8% nickel, and costs 440 per ton.

Steel type 1 must contain at least 3.6% carbon and at most 1.5% nickel. Steel type 2 must contain at least 3.4% carbon and at most 1.7% nickel. In addition, the composition of any steel type must not include more than 40% of alloy 1.

Each ton of steel type 1 is sold at 650, and each ton of steel type 2 is sold at 600.

The goal is to determine how much of each alloy should be used in each type of steel, and how much of each steel type should be produced, to maximize total profit.

Decision variables include the amount of each alloy used in each type of steel, the total amount of steel produced for each type, and the total profit.
